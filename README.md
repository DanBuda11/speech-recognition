# Speech Recognition Example

This is a very simple speech recognition setup using the `webkitSpeechRecognition` API. It records a voice when the button is clicked and renders the speech to the screen as text.

It also uses the "text-to-speech" API to speak back the text that wass recorded using speech-to-text.
